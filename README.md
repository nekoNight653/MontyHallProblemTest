# MontyHallProblemTest
The Monty Hall problem was so weird to me I had to make a program to test it and here it is

Note all the code is on a different branch


    //I made this entire thing because there was some weird thing about picking from three doors then one of them gets revealed,
    // and then you get to pick again. Now supposedly if you switch you have a 33% chance to be right or something,
    // but that sounds like carrying too much old data to me. SO with this I'll be able to test it

    //I link this video
    //https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0
    //It's the Monty Hall Problem

    //It all just seems like applying new data wrong to me.
    //I feel like the instant the new information of the door revealed comes in it nullifies the old information

    ///Note the number of slashes in comments up here is intentional the more slashes the later into development the comment was added
    ///Two slashes for before I tested it
    ///Three for after I tested it, and I'm sure if I update it again,
    /// I'll add a fourth slash for any comments after that

    ///Um, update, I actually think it somehow works.. huh, that's quite magical well I'm glad to have learned!
    ///I mean I guess that means I won since I got new information
    ///I tested this program with a hundred doors and I seemed to win most fo the time if I switched,
    /// and loose most of the time I didn't switch.

    ///Even when I tried to skew the results by knowing my program produces consistently over hundreds of thousands tests
    /// an average for the prize location to be behind door 66 it still seemed to work as it would suggest
    /// (Well not quite as much but I Was Intentionally Skewing The Results)

    ///Though I am curious what the mode of my prize location is over hundreds of thousands of random prize locations
    ///Probably 100, but you never know

    ///Though I think this program tends to produce the prize at higher numbers more often,
    /// it still seems to be under the door I don't choose even when that door is lower

    ///Makes me wonder though if you could take a 50 50 get a friend to put extra doors without you knowing which is which,
    /// and then have you choose and then the friend reveals the doors that she put,
    /// and then if you didn't choose one of their doors you have a higher probability of getting the prize?

    ///Like surely there's some way to manipulate this?
